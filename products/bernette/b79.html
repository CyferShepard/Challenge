					<h4>Easy and quick navigation with touchscreen and multi-function knobs</h4>
					<p>
						Find the right stitch or embroidery design and optimize the thread tension by using the 5-inch color touch screen, which is optimally positioned in the center of the machine. Or quickly change the stich length or width or position your embroidery design via the multi-function knobs . Access the sewing or embroidery tutorials for tips on how to operate your machine or use the creative consultant for advice on the best stitch for your chosen fabric.

					<h4>Bright and spacious for fast and accurate sewing</h4>
					<p>
						You won’t be left in the dark with the four bright LEDs lighting up the sewing area, which offers you 230 mm of space right of the needle. The slide-on freearm extension table gives you extra space and comfort for large sewing or quilting projects.

					<h4>Decorative and quilting stitches for magical embellishments</h4>
					<p>
						Of course, you can hem and zigzag stitch with the b79, sew stretchy t-shirt fabrics and even choose between 17 buttonholes. But there is much more than just the utility stitches: create truly exiting embellishments with 133 decorative and 35 quilting stitches. You want to modify included stitches or create your own ones? Everything is possible with the Stitch Designer. Your individual stitch settings are temporarily saved, and you can store them in your personal memory for future projects.

					<h4>Tie-off function and automatic thread cutter</h4>
					<p>
						With the automatic tie-off function you no longer have to stitch backwards to prevent the seam from unravelling. Simply press the tie-off button at the end of the seam. Next, the automatic thread cutter button, the threads are cut, and your seam is finished! You want it even faster? Program these functions for your foot control with back-kick function – tap your heel once, the seam is automatically finished, and the threads cut off!

					<h4>Even more convenient sewing</h4>
					<p>
						With the semi-automatic needle threader threading is a breeze – the presser foot is automatically lowered to the correct position and the additional thread cutter holds the thread in place. The knee lever for raising or lowering the presser foot will make your sewing even more comfortable, as your hands are free to guide the fabric. And the easy-to-engage, integrated Dual Feed makes sure that all kinds of materials are evenly fed from above and below.

					<h4>Embroidery module with three different-sized hoops and hoop detection</h4>
					<p>
						With three hoops included, it is easy to find the right hoop for each size of your embroidery designs. You can embroider motifs with up to 260 x 160 mm without re-hooping. The hoops are easy to open and close with a quick release system . The automatic hoop detection ensures that you see the defined embroidery area of each hoop on the touch screen, so you can optimally adapt your embroidery design.
